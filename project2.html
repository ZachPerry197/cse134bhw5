        <p>This project was the final assignment for my Recommender Systems class.
            It was a mostly open-ended project where I decided to dive into a large
            dataset with textual and numerical reviews from the different 
            Disneyland parks. I explored different methods of NLP, including 
            sentiment analysis, and trained different models to try and
            predict a user's rating (1-5) from their textual review. The results
            were pretty interesting!
