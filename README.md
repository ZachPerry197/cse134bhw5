Part 3: Other Enhancements
I added actual content to my two projects with a description, images, a pdf, etc. which are my actual projects(before there were just blank pages). I also added functionality to the contact.html site, where the sent messages are now added sequentially to their own jsonbin in the cloud for me to read later. The site is pretty much fully functional now.
